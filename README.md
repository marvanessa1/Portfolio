# Portfolio

## Description
First online portfolio to showcase core skills learned so far during UW Coding Bootcamp course. Goal is to demonstrate to potential future employers of known skills needed to fulfill a part-time or full-time position.

With a "minimalist" theme in mind, background, body, and font colors where kept to black, grey, and white.  All headers along with content were center aligned to keep overall look uniform. All clickable items transform to let user know item contains a link. 

This online portfolio will continue to change and evolve as new coding skills are gained throughout the corse.

## Portfolio Mock-Up

The screenshots below demonstrate the web application's apperence and funtionality:


Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.
To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:
    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```
## Credits
List your collaborators, if any, with links to their GitHub profiles.
If you used any third-party assets that require attribution, list the creators with links to their primary web presence in this section.
If you followed tutorials, include links to those here as well.
## License
The last section of a high-quality README file is the license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, refer to [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/).

üèÜ The previous sections are the bare minimum, and your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections.
## Badges

Badges aren't necessary, per se, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.
## Features
If your project has a lot of features, list them here.
## How to Contribute
If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.
## Tests
Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
