                    <p>Hello, thank you for visiting this page! I'm Vanessa Martinez and this is my first online porfolio!  Keep in mind this is a work in progress</p> <br>
                    <p>I was born and raised in Toppenish, WA, and I'm a proud daughter of immigrants.  I have one brother and two sisters, one dog named Rocky and a cat named Khaleesi, and an adorable nephew and neice.  I graduated from Toppenish High School and later from University of Washington.  I currently reside in Seattle, Washington</p><br>
                    <p>Some of my hobbies include painting, reading, video games, and listening to crime podcasts.  In my free time, I love visiting my family and hanging out with my friends if our schedules allow it.</p><br>
                    <p>I love my current job but I am hoping to learn coding skills to jumpstart into a career in the tech field.  Growing up, I never envisioned myself pursuing coding, but now that I've dipped my toes in it, I want to fully dive in.</p>
